<h4>Step #1, Obtaining the password</h4>
<p>
In order to make an auction, you'll need to have the password for the guest account. In order to get this password, you'll have to go
to http://jzdb.heliohost.org/obtainpassword.htm ; which, there, you must read the contract, which just says that your stuff must be an appropriate
auction, and that it must be an auction, and it says that of every bid made with Jz points, <u>we take 75%</u> of the Jz points; then, obtain the password.</p>
<h4>Step #2, sending the insert MySQL query</h4><br />
<br />Use a MySQL query like this one
<div id="newbox"><br />
mysql_query('INSERT INTO auctstat(Title,Timey,Timemo,Timed,Timem,Times,Owner,bidtyal,Prdes,cat,typs,img,img2,img3,img4,img5,value) VALUES(/*Comma separate the title; year, month[Januaary=0], day, minute, and second that it will end at first; Owner[you]; bid types allowed; product description; category; image sources for 0-5 images*/)')</div></div></center>
