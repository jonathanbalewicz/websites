<title>HOT LINK BLOCK</title>
</head>
<body>This website has hot linked Jz. Jz does not allow hot linking, websites are expected to
host their own images. If you don't know what hot linking is, it's kind of like sending a group of people to go through one gate that they don't own. This file is the gate, and you are are part of the group, and the person who sent you is the website owner. No one can get to this file quickly, if ever
yone in is trying to &quot;get through&quot; at the same time. We have our own gate, and were not letting you through. The website which you came from must make their own. Please contact this site's owner.
