# Websites
This repository contains the websites I have made. I have one website that is currently hosted (<a href="http://worlddevelopers.tk" target="_blank">worlddevelopers.tk</a>), as well as many others. I have written all of the code expect some templates.
## worlddevelopers.tk
This website is currently hosted. I wrote all the code except for the template. This website uses an SQL database to store articles and their images and other information. The articles are retrieved and displayed on each article page. addarticle.html is a hidden page where an article can be added, using createarticle.php 
## jzproducts.tk
This website is not currently hosted. It has a coupon system which gives makes coupon codes to purchase items on amazon.com. getcoupon.php is where the user would recieve coupon codes, and coupon.php and couponadd.php are where coupon codes are added to a MySQL database.
